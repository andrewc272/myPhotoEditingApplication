# Overview 
*For my project I will be creating photo editing software that has the sliders to change values of different photo chages. Much like a diet Lightroom or Raw therapee*

<br>

# Why
*I have been into photography since the beginning of high school. I have always used these programs to edit my photos. With the help of this class I hope to be able to better understand and appreciate what these applications are capable of and why products like Adobe Lightroom have a high price tag for software. It will help me understand the math behind different elements like exposure, lights, shadows, whites, blacks, contrast, and saturation and how these different "sliders" are added together to result in the final result. One major part of my project that I want to research and learn more about is white balance. What is it? How does it work? How can I implement it? What does it take to "auto-white balance" an image?*
